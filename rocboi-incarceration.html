    <h1>RocBoi Quez: The Incarceration</h1>

    <p>
      RocBoi Quez’s incarceration wasn't the end — it was the rebirth. The rapper found himself behind bars due to a chain of events rooted in old warrants, stemming from street-level infractions years ago that caught up with him during a peak in his rising career.
    </p>

    <p>
      While the system saw a number, RocBoi saw the mirror — a moment to reflect, reshape, and regrind. Behind concrete walls, he began plotting his comeback, penning bars from a place of real pain and higher purpose. He chose growth over guilt, and knowledge over the cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Ain’t nothing pretty about the truth,” RocBoi once said in an interview call from lockup. “But truth what’s gonna save you.” He stayed grounded, writing verses to beats he could only imagine — waiting for his shot to hit the booth and share what he went through.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, G Code Publishing stands as part of that comeback. RocBoi Quez’s story reminds everyone that the journey is never straight — but every setback is a seed for the rise.
